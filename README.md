# Line-Follower-Serpent-V.1.0-
PID-controlled line follower robot built using an ESP32 Wroom (30-pin), 
Pololu QTR-8A reflectance sensor, L298N motor driver, and 500 RPM N20 12V motors,
powered by 3 rechargeable accus (≈ 12V).
The system reads 8 analog reflectance values, calculates a precise line position,
and uses a PID algorithm to adjust motor speeds for smooth, fast, and accurate tracking.
